Notes for North Texas Council of RR CLubs (Council)
The ShowTasks.xlmm Excel spreadsheet is used to manage and print the schedule for the train show season.
One fall show (FALL) and one winter show (DAT)
The exact dates are set each year by the council reserving dates with the venue, currently the Plano Convention Center.
Notes on data in the workbook: Lots of data items are shared in named cells, such as "Season". You change the master cell and all other locations that use this text are automatically updated. To find there the named cell is located, under formulas tab, select name mamager. Then select a name and click on the bottom in the 'referes to' box to show the cell with that name.
Note just cell references are used, inside macros names cell data is used on processing reports. Too many to list, but be careful editing cells with names, as you may break a macro running on anpther sheet. 

Tasks are of two types, Show and Preshow.
Show hours are worked by club members during the show. These are allocated in one hour blocks on the day sheets. (Ie, Fall Friday,...)
Pre-show hours are allocated on the S.O.A page in the preshow sections. 
Show hour allocation:
There are 6 show hour sheets, Fall and DAT, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Unused hours are shown in Dark Grey.
Each cell will be either grey (Unused) or have a club ID (Abbreviation)
The Symbol column on Participants page imcludes the club ID and an optional color code for each club.
WHen you open a sheet, a macro automatically checks ALL CLUB ID values against the Participants list, updates the cell colors from the ID list, and highlights an unknown value.

Changing a cell value, such as SC to TRD, will do the following:
1. update the hours allocated to both clubs, 
2. update the statistice on Participants sheet for both clubs
3. update S.O.A. and Matrix statistics

Pre-show allocation:
These hours are updated on the S.O.A. sheet in the pre-show sections.
editing pre-show hours here will change hours assigned in the Participants sheet calculations.
